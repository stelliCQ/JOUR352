<!-- Hello Gagan! I wanted to take a moment to explain an issue that I've encounted with my code in juxtapose. The juxtapose is interactive and does change to accomodate the sizing I used in framework. However it requires me to refresh the page for it to work. It occurs on both types of browsers like Safari and Chrome. I tried everything for it to resize normally like the rest of the page, but I've hit all roadblocks. I don't know if its because my images are big or something. Anyway, please don't fail me LOL. It's interactive with the grid-containers...its just slow.-->

<p> A cargo ship lost power and collided with Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge, early Tuesday morning. The cargo shipped emitted a mayday call before the crash, giving authorities time to halt traffic. The bridge collapsed with eight construction workers on the bridge doing repair work. Two were rescued, another two had their bodies rescued and the other four are presumed dead. They were all immigrant workers. The bridge, also called the Key Bridge, crossed over the Patapsco River and was 1.6 miles long. The bridge commuted more than 30,000 people daily, according to Gov. Wes Moore. The Baltimore port, one of the largest ports in the country, is closed due to the incident and has not yet been determined when it will reopen. The economic and social impact on the port is currently being determined, with the community mourning the lives lost.</p>

<p>Amidst the chaos, there has been a flurry of speculation and confusion on the internet regarding the cause of the bridge's collapse. This page aims to provide a clear and factual timeline of the tragic event that unfolded on Tuesday night, dispelling any misinformation and offering a comprehensive understanding of the incident. </p>
