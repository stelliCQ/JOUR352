<p class="lol"> <small> The one of the entrances of the university with the view of a new apartment complex. (Stella Canino)</small></p>

<p>By Stella S. Canino-Quiñones</p>
<p>May 2, 2024</p>

<p>Annie Newton lives with three other undergraduate students from the University of Maryland in Terrapin Row Apartments. The apartment came with a view of a fraternity house across the street, a hole in the floor, dents on the walls, a broken TV and cockroaches as their surprise roommates. </p>

<p>The next academic semester, Newton and her roommates will move to The Standard at College Park for $200 less monthly.</p>

<p>She made a deal that her parents would cover her rent and she would pay for her student loans.</p>

<blockquote><strong>“Paying $1,500 a month for an apartment in college is absurd,” she said.</strong></blockquote>

<p> Nationwide rental prices have increased so much renters spend more than 30% of their income on rent and utilities, according to Harvard’s Joint Center for Housing Studies research. In College Park the majority of residents are renters and new apartment complexes around the university have increased the number of available units, but the prices do not seem to go down.</p>

<p>College Park's median rent increased 34% in less than 10 years, according to College Park's economic development database. The residential rental trends for residential properties in College Park in Feb. 2018, College Park was $162 more expensive than Baltimore City, and by Feb. 2024, this difference had increased to $297, according to the data. </p>


<p> The price offerings in April for a new lease for the 2024 fall semester in apartment complexes near the university ranges from $1,000 to almost $2,000, not including utilities and other fees.

<p>With the construction of the Purple Line, a 16-mile light rail line that extends from Bethesda, Montgomery County to New Carrollton, Prince George’s County, there are already indications that rent will increase in areas near this new project. </p>

<p>Rent around 11 future stations in Montgomery County rose by $480 between 2015 and 2017, when the project was announced and the ground was broken, compared to $360 per year for two-bedroom apartments in other county areas, according to a University of Maryland study.</p>

  <h3>What is the city's response?</h3>

  <p>The College Park City Council passed a needs-based rent subsidy pilot program for 60 full-time undergraduate students who are Pell Grant recipients and 60 full-time graduate students who have an income below 60% of the area median income. Applicants must show proof of a signed lease apartment or house in College Park. </p>

 <blockquote><strong>
 It would give $1,250 to awardees selected via a lottery system administered by the city. The program will cost $75,000 from funds collected from the three-cent property tax increase for apartments and office buildings from the 2024 fiscal year. </strong> </blockquote>

<p>The city council meeting on April 16 sparked back and forths between students and longtime residents of College Park, who expressed disagreements about the subsidy program.</p>

<p>“The one thing that is missing [in this conversation] is the largest elephant in this city and it’s across the street. It is the University of Maryland,” said Dan Blasberg, a longtime resident of College Park district 2. </p>

<p>Blasberg said that when his family moved in 20 years ago, the university guaranteed housing to all undergraduate students. By the early 2010s, they stopped guaranteeing housing for juniors and seniors and “hoisted them off to Route 1.”</p>

<p>“For the city to take on an issue that has been created by the university and for the university to not step in when these new buildings have been built to work out some deal with them to guarantee some sort of set stable prize, then there’s an issue,” he said.</p>

<p>The city shouldn’t be responsible by itself, he added.</p>

<p>Akash Balenalli, the representative of the university’s Residence Hall Association, told the council that the Department of Resident Life is struggling with capacity being 104%, making the university turn rooms meant for one person to fit two.</p>

<p> The university has a private-public partnership with South Campus Commons and The Courtyards at the University of Maryland that provides subsidized rent, but are very competitive to live in.</p>

<p>The university has no medium to long-term plans to increase on-campus housing.</p>
