<p>Navient Solutions, a large federal student loan servicer, has faced multiple lawsuits from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, several state attorneys and a group of teachers due to negligent practices for student loan borrowers.</p>

<p>The CFPB alleged that Navient misled borrowers on repayment options and cosigner release requirements, reported loans inaccurately to credit bureaus and neglected to inform borrowers about renewal deadlines for income-driven plans in a January 2017 lawsuit.</p>

<p>The lawsuit is still open.</p>

<p>CFPB consumer complaint data showed that the peak number of complaints about Navient the year the CFPB lawsuit was 105 in January 2017. It did not reach the 100s again for the rest of the year. </p>

<p> A major settlement joined by 39 state attorneys in 2022 required Navient to give $1.85 billion in relief to private and federal student loan borrowers. Navient was required to cancel $1.7 billion of subprime private student loan balances for approximately 66,000 borrowers and pay $95 million in restitution payments for approximately 350,000 federal student loan borrowers. </p>

<p> The company must pay the attorneys general $142.5 million and implement reforms to serve student loan borrowers better.</p>

 <p>Maryland was one of the states that joined in on the Navient settlement. </p>

 <p> From Jan. 2017 to Dec. 2023, the majority of complaints about Navient have been centered on “dealing with your lender or servicer” and “struggling to repay my loan,” which encapsulates some of the issues that the CFPB and state attorneys filed against the company, according to the CFPB database. </p>
