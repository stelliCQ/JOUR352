<h1> Welcome to the Wonderful Views of The Island of Enchantment! </h1>

</div>

<h2> This is a ranking by a native about the best public beaches. I grew up near the beaches and explored new locations frequently as a child. This is a list of the beaches I have visited and always recommend to locals and tourists alike. </h2>



<p>This ranking is based on one thing: my personal preference! If you don't like it, deal with it! I also haven't visited all the beaches on the island, so this list is created from the beaches I frequent when I return from the United States.</p>


<div> 

<p>Here is the <strong>list of my top beaches</strong> on the island as a local.</p>

</div>

<h3> Number 10: Condado Beach </h3>

<img src="images/condadobeach.jpeg" width="600" height="600" alt="Condado" class="center">

<p> Condado Beach is one of the most visited beaches on the island due to its proximity to the major hotel chains in San Juan. This beach is ranked at the bottom due to its horrible ocean conditions. This beach is known as the "tourist killer" by locals due to the high currents and waves that the majority of tourists choose to ignore warnings and dive in and then drown. However, due to its proximity to major hotels, it is accessible by foot and in good maritime weather, very nice for the family! </p>

<h3> Number 9: Escambrón Beach </h3>

<img src="images/photo2.jpeg" alt="Escambron" width="600" height="600" class="center">

<p> Escambrón is the closest beach near Old San Juan and Condado. It's a popular beach because of its coral reefs and calm waters. It's a beach accessible on foot if you are staying in an Airbnb or hotel nearby. It's a huge beach with a parking lot that costs $5. It's a very family-friendly environment. The beach has a lot of rocky areas that are hazards if the currents are high. </p>

<h3> Number 8: Isla Verde Beach</h3>

<img src="images/Islaverde.jpeg" width="600" height="600" alt="Isla" class="center">

<p> It is one of the most visited beaches on the island due to its closeness to the major hotel areas and apartment complexes in the metropolitan area. It’s a beach with many restaurants and gift shops for the family. The beaches have many amenities, like renting a beach chair and umbrella and local vendors will sell drinks and food right on the beach. The water has strong currents and waves depending on the season, so it’s recommended you check the weather channel before going to this beach. </p>

<h3> Number 7: Playa Sucia</h3>

<img src="images/Playasucia.jpeg" width="600" height="600" alt="Sucia" class="center">

<p> Although this beach's name is "dirty beach," it's a misnomer for one of the most gorgeous beaches in the southwest of the island. This beach has a magnificent view of the town's lighthouse and luscious green mangroves. There are salt flats behind the beach that are pink due to some science stuff I don't know. It's harmless and makes really cool Facebook pictures. It's a very tricky place to park if you aren't a local and it's far away from major tourist areas. Most locals don't speak English, so get prepared with Duolingo. </p>

<h3> Number 6: Seven Seas Beach </h3>

<img src="images/seven-seas.jpeg" width="800" height="600" alt="Seven" class="center">

<p> One of the most famous beaches on the east side of the island! It’s known for its pine trees and small huts where families can take cover from the sweltering sun. If the security guard is present, the beach has a parking lot that costs $5. The beach includes a well-maintained public bathroom and delicious street food. You get a beautiful view of the bay and open ocean. The beach has areas with hard stones that are tricky to walk. There are a lot of branches in the water and seaweed that can inhibit the full enjoyment depending on the day. </p>

<h3> Number 5: Playa de Piñones </h3>

<img src="images/Pinones-Beach.jpeg" width="600" height="600" alt="Pinones" class="center">

<p>This beach is 15 minutes away from San Juan and is a hidden gastronomical gem for tourists. Piñones is the capital of Puerto Rican street food for cheap prices. The beach is at the end of the restaurant-filled road with an area on the left where you can park your car in the sand. One part of the beach has rock formations that break the upcoming waves. However, the beach can become unswimable due to weather conditions. It’s a very gorgeous beach with crystal clear waters.</p>

<h3> Number 4: La Poza de las Mujeres</h3>

<img src="images/posa4.jpeg" height="600" width="600" alt="Posa" class="center">

<p>This beach, located north of the island, is an underrated gem for tourists and locals alike. A large rock formation breaks the roaring waves, turning the area into a safe oceanic pool. The water is crystalline blue with soft sand and aquatic life roaming free. The beach has parking lots that are free on some days. No street vendors can sell you chairs and umbrellas, so be prepared. The drive from San Juan to this beach is an hour and a half. </p>


<h3>Number 3: Crashboat Beach</h3>

<img src="images/crashboat.jpeg" width="600" height="600" alt="Crash" class="center">

<p> Crashboat is one of the most beloved beaches on the island for locals and tourists staying on the island's west side. This beach used to be a pier for the U.S. military, but with time, tons of sand moved into the area, which created the beach. Now, its most prominent attraction is to jump from the ruins into the water! This beach has low currents and waves, perfect for a relaxing stay. It is very accessible by foot, but parking can be very tricky if you don't arrive early. </p>

<h3> Number 2: Playa Escondida </h3>

<img src="images/playa-escondida1.jpeg" width="600" height="600" alt="Escondida" class="center">

<p> Although its name is "hidden beach," the path is a public secret! You must do a 25-minute hike from Seven Seas Beach through a mangrove forest and reach the secluded beach. The trail to the beach is filled with birds and crabs that show the area's biodiversity. I recommend carrying all your supplies in a bag instead of a cooler due to the rough terrain. It has a shallow tide and crystalline waters. You would park in the Seven Seas Beach parking lot or neighboring areas. </p>

<h3> Number 1: Playa Flamenco </h3>

<p>This beach is found in the island town of Culebra, which is only accessible by plane or ferry. Don't be fooled by its distance! Flamenco is ranked as one of the best beaches in the world! The beach is known for its long, calm waves and bright turquoise waters. The beach has areas with coral reefs that are ideal for snorkeling. I even saw a family of manatees once! The area has places for barbecues, camping and refreshments year around. The beach used to be a military training ground and abandoned tanks are present. It's a tradition to climb the tanks and take a picture for incredible postcards. </p>

<h2>Conclusion and Other Links</h2>


<p> Hundreds of beaches on the island are waiting to be explored on all four sides of the island. I have linked the Puerto Rican government's tourism website. It has a lot of options for different activities and beaches for visitors.
